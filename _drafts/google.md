From november 2015 to june 2016, I have been working with the Google Cultural Institute on the new Google arts and culture website.

Working in Google Paris offices was an amazing opportunity and I enjoyed this project a lot. Trying to facilitate access to cultural media for users from all around the world was very motivating. Most of my work was front-end development using public Google tools (Google Closure Stylesheets and Google templating system) and an internal JavaScript framework.
