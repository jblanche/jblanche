    <h3>Percipio</h3>

    <p>
      Between 2016 and 2018 I worked for <a href="https://www.skillsoft.com/">Skillsoft</a> to help them create the <a href="https://www.skillsoft.com/platform-solution/percipio/">Percipio learning platform</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I joined the team, they just started creating the Percipio webapp so that their customers will have a brand new learning platform to their employees.
      The design choices had already been made (Node.js and React.js for what I was concerned with) but were completely matching my desires at that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was my first professional experience with React.js but I quickly got addicted to the library and the component approach I was already trying to pursue at Google and La Ruche Qui Dit Oui.
      I also likes the Backend for Frontend approach that was made in Node.js to aggregate and filter calls to lower APIs.

            since Percipio is a paid app, you'll only have access to the demo.
