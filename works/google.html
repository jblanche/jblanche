    <h3>Google arts and culture</h3>

    <p>
      From november 2015 to june 2016, I have been working with the Google Cultural Institute on the new Google Arts and Culture website.
    </p>

    <p>
      Working in Google Paris offices was an amazing opportunity and I enjoyed this project a lot.
      Trying to facilitate access to cultural media for users from all around the world was very motivating.
    </p>
    <p>
      The website was designed mobile-first and the first release was in fact mobile only.
      We then worked on a desktop version, sometimes transitioning from the mobile one, sometimes with a brand new design.
      Most of my work was front-end development using public Google tools (Google Closure Stylesheets and Google templating system)
      and an internal JavaScript framework. I sometimes had to do a bit of Java too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before this mission, I mainly worked for small start-ups, dealing with the infrastructure of a large project
      and Google workflows was new to me but I learned a lot from this.
