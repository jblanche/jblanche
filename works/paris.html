    <h2>Paris.fr</h2>

    <p>
      In 2015 I worked with Etamin Studio and the Paris Numeric offices to create a brand new experience for parisians and tourists on the website of the most visited city in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      With very good designs in hand our work was to create a styleguide for all the elements of the website to facilitate the integration of new contents.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the work was HTML / CSS in the first time. And choosing the right tools so that the templates we designed for the styleguide could be reused as is in the website. We used Jade as the templating system and Sass as the Stylesheet guide because they both have a very good support in the Node.JS community so that it was easy to integrate with the Node.JS backend created by the Paris Numeric offices. <br>
      I then worked with the backend team to integrate the worked we did in their stack.
