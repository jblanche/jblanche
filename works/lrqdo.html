    <h3>La Ruche Qui Dit Oui</h3>
    <p>
      From 2012 to 2014, I helped La Ruche Qui Dit Oui to create a brand new experience for their users. <br>
      I was the lead (and only) frontend developper at the beginning of the refactoring, and then joined by developers hired by La Ruche Qui Dit Oui.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Working for a project trying to convince people of the benefits of local food in a very friendly parisian start-up was a pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      My firsts missions were to compare the tools available at that time and to choose the technologies we were going to use in the front-end. <br>
      After this choice (Backbone.JS / Marionnette.JS / Sass), I started implementing the first responsive designs made by their designer. Later on I helped the team on all the aspects of the front-end site, from the subscription to the selling processâ€¦
