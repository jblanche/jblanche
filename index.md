### Skills

#### Front-end Developper

Front-end has been my primary focus for a few years now.
I develop standards-based websites with HTML / CSS / JavaScript.
I focus on writing clean and efficient code that will run on any kind of device.
I previously worked with some of the most common JavaScript frameworks (React / Backbone / Marionette…).


#### Back-end Developper

Even if I have been focusing on frond-end these last years, I still like to do some back-end too!
NodeJS and Ruby on Rails and are my favorite tools.

#### Web evangelist

I enjoy my work so much I want to share it with others.
I'm teaching web development at GOBELINS, l'école de l'image in Paris and giving JavaScript training course with Delicious Insights.
I'm available for consulting.

#### Creative Coder

As a Lab212 member,
I participated in the creation of innovative, interactive and artistic projects such as Galets Magiques and Minuscules.



### Contact

As ten years passed doing a job I love, I now have a good idea of the kind of project I want to work on next.
Right now, my choice is to participate in meaningful long-term projects like the ones listed above.

Beeing a freelancer allows me to travel far away for holidays. I really enjoy that, it believe it makes me a happier and better developper.

Working in a nice, respectful and welcoming environments is also an important criteria.

If you think we can work together, please contact me!
