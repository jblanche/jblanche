The Rails Ecosystem ! 

I love Rails, I immediatly liked it the first time I tried to build a small app, with the good old Rails 1.1.1 if my memory don't betraue me on this one.


But 5 years later, I have to admit that more than Rails itself, I love working with Rails because of the rails Ecosystem. 

Learning Rails, I learned about so much thing about the Web itself, Server Administration and all a lot of other stuff.


In rails : 
  MVC architectural pattern

  M
   ORM 
   NoSQL
  V
    Better Javascript (Lowpro, Prototype vs Jquery , Agnocism javascript) 
    Better CSS (SASS - Less)
    Better HTML HAML  
  C
    REST software architecture
    HTTP caching

Outside of rails : 
  Memcache
  Kestrel message queue server (Kestrel)
  Background jobs (resque)
